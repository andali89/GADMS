This is an implementation of the multi-objective optimization method called 
GADMS for key quality characteristic selection (feature selection).
The optimization method combines the GA with direct multiseach to perform 
the evolutionary process. For a detailed description of the method please 
refer to

hybridization of a genetic algorithm and direct multisearch for key quality 
characteristic selection, Information Sciences 523 (2020) 245-265.
