# GADMS Implementation

This is an implementation of the multi-objective optimization method called 
GADMS for key quality characteristic selection (feature selection).
The optimization method combines the GA with direct multiseach to perform 
the evolutionary process. For a detailed description of the method please 
refer to 


> A.-D. Li, B. Xue and M. Zhang, Multi-objective feature selection using 
hybridization of a genetic algorithm and direct multisearch for key quality 
characteristic selection, Information Sciences 523 (2020) 245-265.

To run the code, please click on [Main.m](GADMS_matlab_code/Main.m) . The code requires the jar fild of [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) , which is a Machine Learning Software in Java.
