# GADMS Implementation

This is an implementation of the multi-objective optimization method called 
GADMS for key quality characteristic selection (feature selection).
The optimization method combines the GA with direct multiseach to perform 
the evolutionary process. For a detailed description of the method please 
refer to

hybridization of a genetic algorithm and direct multisearch for key quality 
characteristic selection, Information Sciences 523 (2020) 245-265. [[BibTeX](https://andali89.github.io/homepage/bibfiles/Li2020GADMS.bib)] [[pdf](https://andali89.github.io/homepage/pubs/2020_GADMS.pdf)] [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2020.03.032](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2020.03.032)

To run the code, please click on [Main.m](GADMS_matlab_code/Main.m) . The code requires the jar file ([weka.jar](GADMS_matlab_code/weka.jar)) of [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), which is a Machine Learning Software in Java.
